Each goal is quantified and has a deadline, to be achieved by the end of 2015. Goal 6 is to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV, malaria and tuberculosis (TB).\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The BRICS countries had almost than 328 thousand deaths due to TB in 2013. The median shows that half of these coutries had fewer than 25,000 deaths. The much higher mean (over 65,480) indicates that some countries had a very high number. The least affected country was Brazil, with 4400 deaths, and the most affected was India with 240 thousand deaths in a single year. However, taking the population size into account, the most affected was South Africa with over 47 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the PA countries had almost than 5,490 deaths due to TB in 2013. The median shows that half of these coutries had fewer than 1,485 deaths. The lower mean (over 1,372) indicates that some countries had a low number. The least affected country was Chile, with 220 deaths, and the most affected was Peu with 2300 deaths in a single year. Now, taking the population size into account, the most affected was Peru over 7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants having a particular dramatically situation against the other AP  countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the numbers we can see a wide gap between average and median for the BRICS countries, unlike the AP countries, so we conclude that the health problems of the PA countries are more homogeneous than for the BRICS countries. That could be because they are geographically close to each other and share the same language and similar culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should not forget that most values are estimates. Nevertheless, they convey the message that TB is still a major cause of fatalities, than there is not a correlation between deaths and size of population, and that there is a huge disparity between countries, with several ones being highly affected."
